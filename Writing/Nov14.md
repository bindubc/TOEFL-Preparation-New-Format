**TOEFL Passage:**

At the end of the Triassic period, about 200 million years ago, a mass extinction event occurred that wiped out over half of all living species. This event paved the way for dinosaurs to dominate for the next 145 million years. While the exact cause of the extinction remains uncertain, several theories have been proposed.

One theory suggests a decline in sea levels. During the late Triassic period, sea levels fluctuated, and when they fell, they destroyed the habitats of coastal and shallow ocean species. This destruction would have had a significant impact on food chains worldwide, leading to mass extinctions.

Another theory attributes the event to massive climate cooling. This was a time of extensive volcanic activity, and volcanoes released large quantities of sulfur dioxide (SO2). High levels of SO2 in the atmosphere can lower global temperatures, and such a climate shift could have led to the extinction of many species.

A third theory involves an asteroid strike. Asteroids occasionally collide with Earth, and when they do, they can create craters and throw debris into the atmosphere, blocking sunlight for months or even years. This lack of sunlight could have killed plants, leading to a collapse in food chains and contributing to the mass extinction.

**Speaking Notes:**

In a lecture on this topic, the professor mentions that while the theories discussed in the reading are interesting, none of them provides a solid explanation for the mass extinction at the end of the Triassic Period.

First, regarding sea level changes, scientists agree that sea levels fluctuated during the period, often falling. However, this fluctuation was gradual, happening over millions of years. Ecosystems, particularly those in shallow waters, are generally adaptable to slow environmental changes. A sudden drop in sea level would be needed for a major extinction, but that doesn’t align with the gradual nature of the sea level change.

Second, the theory of global cooling caused by sulfur dioxide is also questioned. While sulfur dioxide can indeed lower global temperatures, this effect is short-lived. Once sulfur dioxide is released into the atmosphere, it combines with water and falls back to Earth as rain. This means the cooling effect would have lasted for only a few years, too short to cause a mass extinction.

Finally, the asteroid impact theory is largely dismissed by scientists. While an asteroid impact can create a large crater, there is no evidence of a crater from that period. The only crater found dates back about 12 million years before the extinction event, which is far too early to be linked to the Triassic extinction. Therefore, the asteroid theory seems unlikely to explain the event.

**Mass Extinction at the End of the Triassic Period: Theories and Debates**

At the end of the Triassic period, around 200 million years ago, a mass extinction event wiped out over half of all living species, reshaping the course of life on Earth. This event set the stage for the rise of dinosaurs, which would dominate the planet for the next 145 million years. While scientists agree that the extinction was widespread, the exact cause remains uncertain. Several theories have been proposed, but none provide a conclusive explanation.

One theory suggests that fluctuating sea levels contributed to the extinctions. As sea levels fell towards the end of the Triassic period, coastal and shallow-water ecosystems were destroyed, devastating both marine and land species that relied on these habitats. The loss of such crucial ecosystems would have disrupted food chains across the planet, potentially leading to the mass extinction. However, this theory has been contested because the sea level changes were gradual, taking place over millions of years. Species in these ecosystems are often capable of adapting to slow environmental shifts, making this explanation less likely for the sudden mass extinction.

Another theory points to massive climate cooling due to volcanic activity. During this time, volcanoes released large quantities of sulfur dioxide (SO2) into the atmosphere, which is known to lower global temperatures. This cooling effect could have had a catastrophic impact on many species, causing their extinction. However, this theory is also debated, as the cooling effect caused by sulfur dioxide is short-lived. The gas quickly combines with water in the atmosphere and falls back to Earth as rain, meaning any significant cooling would have only lasted for a few years. This does not seem long enough to account for the widespread extinctions that occurred.

Finally, some have proposed that an asteroid impact caused the extinction. When large asteroids strike Earth, they can displace massive amounts of debris, blocking sunlight for months or even years. This would prevent photosynthesis and collapse food chains, leading to the extinction of many species. However, the asteroid theory faces challenges as well. While an asteroid impact may have occurred during this period, no crater has been found that dates to the time of the extinction. The only known crater from that era is much older, suggesting that the asteroid impact theory does not fully explain the event.

Despite the intriguing nature of these theories, none of them has been conclusively proven. The mass extinction at the end of the Triassic remains a complex mystery, and further research may be needed to uncover the true cause of this pivotal moment in Earth's history.
