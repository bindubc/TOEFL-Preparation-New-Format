**Reading Passage:**  
Many scientists believe it would be possible to maintain a permanent human presence on Mars or the Moon. On the other hand, conditions on Venus are so extreme and inhospitable that maintaining a human presence there would be impossible.  

First, atmospheric pressure at Venus’ surface is at least 90 times greater than the pressure at Earth’s surface. This means that a force of 100 kilograms is pressing down on every square centimeter of surface. All spacecraft that have landed on Venus have been crushed by this extreme pressure within an hour of landing. Almost anything humans might land on Venus would be crushed as well.  

Second, as far as we know, there are no reservoirs of water on Venus’ surface, and the planet’s atmosphere, made up mostly of carbon dioxide, nitrogen, and sulfuric acid, contains hardly any oxygen or water vapor. Water and oxygen would therefore probably have to be supplied to Venus from Earth. The idea of ensuring a regular supply of water and oxygen from Earth is impractical in the extreme and would probably defeat the purpose of establishing a permanent station on Venus.  

Third, very little sunlight reaches the planet’s surface. About 60 percent of the sunlight that hits Venus is reflected back into space by the thick clouds that fill the atmosphere, which means that only 40 percent of the sunlight can get through the clouds. Below these clouds is a dense layer of carbon dioxide, which blocks even more light, so very little light reaches the surface. The lack of light would prevent the use of solar power cells, so humans could not get electricity to power their machines and equipment.

**Lecture:**  
Setting up a permanent station on Venus may not be without challenges, but it is certainly possible. One solution that has been proposed is to establish a station that would float in Venus's atmosphere like a balloon, rather than standing on its surface. This station would float approximately 50 kilometers above Venus's surface, and the problems mentioned in the reading can be solved at this altitude.  

First, regarding atmospheric pressure, it is a well-known physical fact that the pressure decreases significantly at higher altitudes. At 50 kilometers above Venus’s surface, the pressure is equal to the normal pressure we are accustomed to on Earth. Therefore, there would be no danger of the station being crushed.  

Second, the lack of water and oxygen on Venus’s surface can be addressed. The compounds found in Venus’s atmosphere, such as carbon dioxide and sulfuric acid, can be chemically processed to create water and oxygen. These materials can be easily extracted from the atmosphere, meaning the water and oxygen necessary for human survival could be produced on-site, eliminating the need to import them from Earth.  

Third, the issue of limited sunlight is less significant at higher altitudes. While clouds still exist 50 kilometers above the surface, they are not very thick at that level, allowing a considerable amount of sunlight to filter through. Moreover, because the clouds reflect sunlight, the station could collect both direct sunlight and reflected sunlight using solar power cells. This dual-source collection would generate more than enough electricity to power the station.

**Integrated Writing Response:**  
The reading passage argues that maintaining a human presence on Venus is impossible due to extreme atmospheric pressure, the absence of water and oxygen, and the lack of sunlight reaching the surface. However, the lecture provides solutions to these challenges, suggesting that a floating station in Venus’s atmosphere could make human habitation feasible.  

First, the reading claims that the extreme atmospheric pressure on Venus’s surface would crush any human-made structure. In contrast, the lecture explains that at an altitude of about 50 kilometers above the surface, the pressure is comparable to Earth’s surface pressure. This makes it safe for a floating station to operate without the risk of being crushed.  

Second, the reading points out that Venus lacks water and oxygen, making resupply from Earth impractical. The lecture counters this by proposing that chemical processes could extract water and oxygen from Venus’s atmosphere, which contains compounds like carbon dioxide and sulfuric acid. These processes would eliminate the need to transport these resources from Earth.  

Lastly, the reading argues that very little sunlight reaches Venus’s surface, preventing the use of solar power. The lecture refutes this by stating that at 50 kilometers above the surface, the clouds are thinner, allowing significant sunlight to filter through. Additionally, the station could harness sunlight reflected by the clouds below, enabling it to generate sufficient electricity for its needs.  

In summary, while the reading highlights the challenges of establishing a human presence on Venus, the lecture provides practical solutions that make a floating station in Venus’s atmosphere a viable option.
