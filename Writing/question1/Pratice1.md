## Passage: 

Burning coal in power plants produces a waste product called coal ash, a material that contains small amounts of potentially harmful chemicals. Environmentalists in the United States are concerned about the damage such harmful chemicals may be doing to the environment and suggest that the United States government should create new, much stricter regulations for handling and storing coal ash.

However, representatives of power companies take the opposite view: they argue that new regulations are unnecessary and might actually have negative consequences. They use the following arguments to support their position.

**Regulations Exist**

First, power company representatives point out that effective environmental regulations already exist. For example, one very important regulation requires companies to use liner—special material that prevents coal ash components from leaking into the soil and contaminating the surrounding environment. Companies that dispose of coal ash in disposal ponds or landfills must use liner in every new pond or landfill they build.
Concerns About Recycling Coal Ash

Second, some analysts predict that creating very strict rules for storing and handling coal ash might discourage the recycling of coal ash into other products. Currently, a large portion of coal ash generated by power plants is recycled: it is used, for example, in building materials such as concrete and bricks. Recycling coal ash reduces the need to dispose of it in other ways and presents no environmental danger. However, if new, stricter rules are adopted for handling coal ash, consumers may become concerned that recycled coal ash products are just too dangerous, and may stop buying the products.

**Increased Cost**

Finally, strict new regulations would result in a significant increase in disposal and handling costs for the power companies—perhaps as much as ten times the current costs. Power companies would be forced to increase the price of electricity, which would not be welcomed by the general public.


## Lecture:

Now listen to part of a lecture on the topic you just read about. There should definitely be stricter rules adopted for handling and spoke of coal ash first, the regulations we have now, for example, those require companies to use liner are not really sufficient. Under the current regulations, liner has been used only when a company builds a new landfill or a new pond, but companies are not required to add a minor to old ponds and landfills, yet, several of those older disposal sites have caused significant damage. For example, the chemicals from coal ash leap into groundwater and contaminate drinking water. We absolutely need stricter new regulations that will prevent environmental damage at all coal ash disposal sites, the new sites, as well as the old ones. Second. Stricter rules for handling coal ash won't necessarily mean that consumers will stop using recycled coal ash products. Let's look at how people responded to strict regulations for other dangerous materials, mercury, for example, Mercury is a fairly hazardous material, and it's been subject to very strict handling and storage rules for a long time. Yet despite those rules, it's been successfully and safely recycled for over 50 years, and consumers have very few concerns about it, so it's unlikely that consumers will become afraid to buy recycled coal ash products if strict regulations are adopted. Third it's true that the cost of coal Azure and handling will increase, but in this case, the result is well worth the extra cost. According to analysts, the cost to the power companies of implementing these rules would be about $15 billion that sounds like a lot, but when you actually do the math, it would increase the average consumer's household electricity bill by only about 1% That's not a big price to pay for having a cleaner environment.


## Writing task:


The reading passage discusses the debate over whether the United States should implement stricter regulations for handling and storing coal ash, a byproduct of burning coal in power plants. The passage outlines three main arguments from power company representatives against stricter regulations: the existence of current regulations, the potential negative impact on coal ash recycling, and the increased cost of disposal and handling. However, the lecture counters these arguments, advocating for stricter regulations.


Firstly, the reading claims that effective regulations already exist, such as the requirement for companies to use liners in new coal ash disposal sites. However, the lecturer argues that these regulations are insufficient. While liners are required for new landfills and ponds, older disposal sites, which are not covered by the current regulations, have caused significant environmental damage. The lecturer provides an example of how chemicals from older sites have leached into groundwater, contaminating drinking water. This highlights the need for stricter regulations that cover all disposal sites, both new and old, to prevent such environmental damage.


Secondly, the reading suggests that stricter regulations might discourage recycling of coal ash, as consumers may perceive recycled coal ash products as unsafe. The lecturer refutes this by comparing coal ash to mercury, another hazardous material with strict regulations. Despite stringent rules for mercury, it has been recycled safely and successfully for over 50 years without consumer backlash. This implies that, similar to mercury, recycled coal ash can be safely managed even with stricter regulations, without significantly affecting consumer confidence.


Finally, the reading argues that implementing stricter regulations would drastically increase disposal and handling costs, potentially leading to a rise in electricity prices. The lecturer acknowledges this concern but argues that the environmental benefits outweigh the costs. While the implementation of stricter regulations would indeed raise costs, the increase in the average household electricity bill would be relatively small, about 1%. The lecturer suggests that this minor increase is a reasonable trade-off for ensuring a cleaner environment.


In summary, while the reading presents arguments against stricter coal ash regulations, the lecture effectively counters these points by highlighting the insufficiencies of current regulations, the potential for safe recycling under stricter rules, and the manageable cost increases associated with better environmental protection.
