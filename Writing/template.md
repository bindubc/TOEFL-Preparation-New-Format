The reading and lecture both discuss the <mass extinction at the end of the Triassic period, which affected over half of all species>. 
    The reading proposes <three main theories for the cause: declining sea levels, global cooling from volcanic activity, and an asteroid strike.> 
    However, the lecturer disputes each of these explanations, arguing that none adequately explains <the mass extinction>

First, the reading suggests that <fluctuating sea levels caused mass extinction by destroying habitats in coastal and shallow-water areas.>
     The lecturer counters this by stating that <coastal and shallow-water species are typically adaptable to gradual environmental changes. Since the sea level decline was a slow process over millions of years, it would not have caused the sudden widespread extinction observed.

Second, the author claims that <volcanic eruptions released large amounts of sulfur dioxide (SO₂), which lowered global temperatures and harmed many species.
   The lecturer, however, argues that this explanation is unlikely because <SO₂ does not remain in the atmosphere long enough to cause long-term cooling. 
   She explains that <SO₂ combines with water and falls back to Earth as rain shortly after being released, so it could not have caused prolonged climate change.

Finally, the reading posits that <an asteroid impact could have led to the extinction by blocking sunlight with debris.
  In contrast, the lecturer dismisses this theory, noting that <no asteroid crater from the time of the extinction has been found. While there is a known crater, it dates to 12 million years before the extinction event, too early to be a contributing factor.>

In conclusion, the lecturer challenges each of the reading’s theories, asserting that they lack sufficient evidence to explain <the Triassic mass extinction>
