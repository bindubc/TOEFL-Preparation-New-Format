The term “social facilitation” refers to the phenomenon in which individuals tend to perform better on simple tasks when they are in the presence of others than when they are alone. The drive theory of social facilitation suggests that the presence of others increases drive (motivation to succeed) and this, in turn, affects task performance. If the mere presence of an audience accounts for increased drive, then any kind of audience—even one that is blindfolded and cannot observe or evaluate performance—should produce social facilitation effects. If, however, other factors such as concern over the audience’s evaluations (evaluation apprehension) play a role in drive, then type of audience should matter. In fact, several studies have found this to be the case: for instance, social facilitation effects did not occur if the audience was blindfolded or showed no interest in watching the person performing the task. Such findings suggest that concern over being evaluated—not just increased drive—plays a role in social facilitation.

Reasonable as this conclusion may seem, however, it does not appear to apply in all cases. In one ingenious study, cockroaches (a kind of insect) were placed either in simple mazes where the animals had to run straight ahead to escape from a bright light, or in more complex ones in which they had to choose the correct path to escape from the light. Audiences of other cockroaches were placed next to them. Results were fully consistent with the drive theory: The presence of an audience of other cockroaches facilitated performance on the simple maze but reduced performance on the complex maze. However, it seems weird to suggest that insects are concerned about the impressions they make on others. In such cases, it is hard to believe that social facilitation stems solely from evaluation apprehension. So what is the final answer? Modern research suggests that it may involve cognitive mechanisms related to attentional focus.

According to one researcher, Robert S. Baron, the presence of other persons can be distracting and can therefore threaten the organism with cognitive overload (more stimulation than can be processed) when performing a task. Specifically, task performers must divide their attention between the task and the audience, and this generates both increased motivation and the possibility of cognitive overload. Cognitive overload, in turn, tends to restrict one’s attention so as to focus only on essential cues or stimuli while screening out nonessential ones.

Several findings offer support for this view, known as distraction-conflict theory. For example, audiences produce social facilitation effects only in situations where directing attention to an audience conflicts in some way with task demands. Similarly, individuals experience greater distraction when they perform certain kinds of tasks in front of an audience than when they perform them alone.

But a key question remains: Which is more important—increased drive or the tendency toward a narrowed attentional focus? According to Baron, drive theory and distraction-conflict theory make contrasting predictions with respect to one particular type of task: a poorly learned task that involves only a few key stimuli. Drive theory predicts that the presence of others will increase errors on a poorly learned task. In contrast, the attentional focus perspective predicts that the presence of others will cause individuals to focus more closely on the important task-relevant cues in this particular situation, with the result that performance will be improved. These predictions were tested by Pascal Huguet and his colleagues (1999) in a series of studies whose results offered strong support for the attentional focus perspective.

In sum, it appears that cognitive processes—not just various drive factors such as concern over being evaluated—play an important role in social facilitation. The presence of others may well produce increased drive, but it may do so because of the cognitive demands of paying attention both to an audience and to the task being performed, as distraction-conflict theory suggests, and it may influence task performance by inducing a narrowed attentional focus. One advantage of this cognitive perspective is that it helps explain why animals as well as people are affected by the presence of an audience. A theory that can explain similar patterns of behavior among organisms ranging from cockroaches to human beings is powerful indeed.
