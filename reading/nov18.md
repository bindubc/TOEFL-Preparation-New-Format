Psychologists have developed several ways of grouping human motivations into distinct categories. One way is to distinguish primary motivations from secondary motivations. Primary motivations—such as the desire for food and water—serve obviousbiological needs. Secondary motivations develop as a result of specific learning experiences; they do not serve any biological need directly, although they may lead indirectly to the satisfaction of primary motivations.

Presumably, we learn secondary motivations because they help us to satisfy primary motivations. For example, we learn a desire for money (a secondary motivation) because it helps us to obtain food, water, and shelter (primary motivations). In some cases, however, a secondary motivation seems to develop a momentum of its own, becoming apparently independent of the original primary motivations associated with it. For example, someone may start collecting coins or stamps (a secondary motivation) in hopes of making a profit or because the collection leads to praise from other coin or stamp enthusiasts. Eventually some collectors devote enormous money and effort to their collections, demonstrating that they have become interested in the stamps for their own sake.

Psychologists have attempted to list and classify motivations but have found the task complex and difficult to organize; however, because the biological needs of the body are limited, they expect to find only a limited number of primary motivations. One structured way of listing primary and secondary human motivations was developed by Abraham Maslow. According to Maslow, our behavior is governed by a hierarchy of needs. In this ranking, the most basic are the physiological needs for food, water, oxygen, and warmth. Maslow holds that these basic needs, which are at the bottom of his hierarchy, ordinarily take priority over all others. For example, people who are gasping for breath will not take time out to do something else before they have satisfied their need for oxygen. Once people have satisfied all of their physiological needs, they seek to satisfy their safety needs, such as security from attack and avoidance of pain. When those needs are satisfied, they proceed to the needs for love and belonging—making friends and socializing with them. Next come the needs for esteem, such as gaining prestige and a feeling of accomplishment. At the top of Maslow’s hierarchy is the need for self-actualization, the need to achieve one’s full potential, for example, by excelling in creative activities or athletic endeavors.

Maslow’s theory is appealing because it recognizes a wide range of human motivations—from satisfying our biological needs to savoring the joy of accomplishment. Moreover, it suggests that the various motivations are not equal. When they conflict, the basic physiological needs take priority over safety needs, which take priority over the need for love, and so on. Maslow’s hierarchy has been widely accepted, although it has inspired little research, and what research has been done has often failed to support the theory. No evidence supports the idea that motivations fall into five distinct categories. That is, the differences between the need for oxygen and the need for food (both basic physiological needs) are as great as the differences between the need for love and the need for self-esteem. More important, people sometimes work to satisfy higher-level needs before they satisfy lower-level needs. Even when people are ravenous, they might skip a meal to be with someone they love, or to study for a test, or to accept an award. Throughout history, people have willingly sacrificed their lives to advance some political or religious cause. Depending on the circumstances, almost any motivation may take priority over the others, at least temporarily.

What then do various types of motivated behaviors have in common? The foremost characteristic is that they are goal-directed and persist until the goal is reached. For example, when people feel cold, they may act in a number of different ways to become warm: they may put on sweaters, go inside, or just stand and shiver. To determine whether a particular behavior is motivated, as opposed to automatic or reflexive, an observer needs to watch an individual over a period of time in a variety of circumstances. If the individual varies the behavior at different times and persists until reaching a goal, then the behavior is motivated.
