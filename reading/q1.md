The Tiwanaku state, on the southern shore of Lake Titicaca in what is now Bolivia in South America, flourished in the second half of the first millennium but had collapsed by 1100 C.E. Some have suggested that this collapse was due to a violent event such as an invasion or to a dramatic decrease in population caused by migration out of Tiwanaku. A more likely explanation for the immediate cause is a drought (a period of unusually low rainfall) that destroyed the core territory’s raised-field agricultural systems. In these systems, fields were surrounded by channels filled with water that was used to irrigate the fields. In fact, paleoclimatic research supports the occurrence of severe drought in the post–1000 C.E. period. However, it appears instead that the collapse of Tiwanaku was a political and social organizational phenomenon. Although drought was certainly a factor, it cannot explain the collapse in full. For one thing, Tiwanaku’s collapse was long, occurring over at least three generations and probably even more (assuming one generation is 30 years). Its collapse was not caused by an immediate crisis, such as an invasion of foreigners or a sudden climatic change, but resulted from a gradual process over several generations


The 1000–1100 C.E. drought undoubtedly would have affected the Tiwanaku populations’ ability to maintain raised-field agriculture. Throughout the southern Titicaca basin there are numerous examples of attempts to ameliorate the drought conditions by building canals, aqueducts, and reservoirs to better transport and store water. By 1100 C.E., the technological limits of these engineering responses had been reached. Raised fields are significant not just for the amount of food that they can produce as opposed to rain-fed agriculture; they are also an economic activity that concentrates populations. An intensive form of agriculture that produces consistent yields, raised fields permitted the concentration of large populations in relatively small areas. The drought conditions that made large-scale raised-field agriculture unfeasible would have also promoted the dispersal of populations.
