speaking question : Final Project
The final project for this course will be an oral presentation. Students must work with an assigned partner to select a topic and complete all related research for the project. The partners will orally present their research to the class during the last two weeks of classes. This project will provide students with the opportunity to discover the rewards and challenges of working with another individual, an experience that will help them in future endeavors. Furthermore, these presentations will benefit the entire class: when students share their discoveries with the class, they enable other students to learn from their work.   Conversation audio: Listen to two students discussing the assignment. I don't know about this. Why not? Sounds okay to me. Thing is, depending on someone else makes me nervous. My roommate had to do a project like this, and the other girl didn't show up to meetings, didn't do any research. My roommate had to do everything herself. That's a drag. I guess if your partner's irresponsible, you're out of luck. Exactly. It hurt her grade. I don't want the same thing to happen to me right now. I'm more concerned with getting a good grade, even though I know that's not the lesson the professor has in mind. Still, it'll be good to listen to everyone's stuff. Well, I don't know. I mean, at the end of the semester, people are focused on studying for exams. Yeah, who has time to put something like this together when they're busy studying true I can't imagine anyone will be able to really do a good job with it, and everyone will be so preoccupied by then that they probably won't listen anyway. I think the professor's going to be disappointed, and students, well, we'll all just be frustrated by the whole thing. 




In response to the discussion between the two students about the final project, we can identify two main concerns:

1. **Dependence on a partner**: The female student is anxious about working with a partner because of her roommate's negative experience with a similar project. Her roommate's partner didn't contribute, causing her to take on all the work and affecting her grade. This leads the female student to worry that her partner might not be reliable, putting her grade at risk.

2. **Timing of the project**: Both students feel that the timing of the project is problematic. Since the project is scheduled for the end of the semester, when students are focused on studying for exams, they think that many students won't have the time to do a good job on the project. They also believe that the class won't pay attention to the presentations because of the preoccupation with exams.

### Summary:
The female student is concerned about depending on a partner who might not contribute, which could negatively affect her grade. Additionally, both students think the project is poorly timed, as students will be focused on exams and won't be able to perform well or engage with the presentations.
