A major climate change can lead to species extinction, as demonstrated by the Thunderbird, a giant flightless bird that lived in Australia 35,000 years ago. Scientists discovered many Thunderbird bones near an ancient dried-up lake, suggesting that these birds gathered there during a drought caused by climate change. The lake was likely one of the last remaining sources of water. However, as the drought continued and the lake eventually dried up, the birds had no water to survive and died. This prolonged drought, caused by climate change, led to the extinction of the Thunderbird. This example shows how significant climate changes can disrupt ecosystems and result in species extinction.

Major climate change in the environment leads to the extinction of many birds, animals, and plants. There is much evidence and research on these incidents. I want to mention one such incident that happened in Australia: the thunderbird, which lived 35000 years ago whose bones were found in the lake. This Ancient Lake was once known for its freshwater storage. During the period of drought, the thunderbirds migrated to this lake for survival, the lake dried up and species like thunderbirds were impacted with no water to survive which in turn led to the extinction of thunderbirds. Hence, the lake dried up because of climate change causing the extinction of the thunderbird family species.
